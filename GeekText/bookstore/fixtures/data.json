When she was young, Lisa\u2019s father was a mythical figure who was rarely present in her life. As she grew older, her father took an interest in her, ushering her into a new world of mansions, vacations, and private schools. His attention was thrilling, but he could also be cold, critical and unpredictable. When her relationship with her mother grew strained in high school, Lisa decided to move in with her father, hoping he\u2019d become the parent she\u2019d always wanted him to be. Part portrait of a complex family, part love letter to California in the seventies and eighties, Small Fry is a poignant coming-of-age story from one of our most exciting new literary voices.",

Only in New York.\" Immediately, the public, professionals, and press were choosing sides over Pluto''s planethood. Pluto is entrenched in our cultural and emotional view of the cosmos, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, award-winning author and director of the Rose Center, is on a quest to discover why. He stood at the heart of the controversy over Pluto''s demotion, and consequently Plutophiles have freely shared their opinions with him, including endless hate mail from third-graders. With his inimitable wit, Tyson delivers a minihistory of planets, describes the oversized characters of the people who study them, and recounts how America''s favorite planet was ousted from the cosmic hub.",

Between those two historic events lay more adventures than an ordinary person could imagine as Cernan repeatedly put his life, his family and everything he held dear on the altar of an obsessive desire.

By the time he was thirteen, Urschel was auditing a college-level calculus course. But when he joined his high school football team, a new interest began to eclipse the thrill he felt in the classroom. Football challenged Urschel in an entirely different way, and he became addicted to the physical contact of the sport. After he accepted a scholarship to play at Penn State, his love of math was rekindled. As a Nittany Lion, he refused to sacrifice one passion for the other. Against the odds, Urschel found a way to manage his double life as a scholar and an athlete. While he was an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, he simultaneously pursued his PhD in mathematics at MIT.",

Lisa Brennan-Jobs grew up as the unexpected and often unacknowledged daughter of Steve Jobs and artist Chrisann Brennan. I''ll admit, I''m not terribly interested in the personal lives of the rich and famous so I didn''t know much about Steve Jobs going into this book. To say he was a difficult man is an understatement, to say he was cruel, emotionally distant and often emotionally abusive towards his daughter is closer to the truth. In this book Lisa shares in exquisite and uncompromising detail, what it is like to grow up feeling abandoned and unwanted. Even her mother, who was a constant presence, was unable to provide the stability and emotional security a young child requires. Often as I was reading I wondered if Lisa was better off before her father acknowledged her rather than after she went to live with him. His ability to withdraw approval and affection were callous and calculated. He seems unable to connect emotionally with everyone around him, and his conversations and actions are often disconnected, if not wildly inappropriate. Lisa''s writing is poetic and filled with nostalgic images and experiences of what it was like to grow up in the 1980''s. Her memories are sharp and vibrant, evoking a visceral response from the reader. Even while she speaks of the ambivalence of her relationship with her father and the turbulence of her relationship with her mother, she remains firmly rooted in place and time in which she grew up. Her sense of place and time shine throughout the memoir and are as much a part of the story as the people who inhabit it. While this book isn''t an easy read by any means, it is a worthy one. Brennan-Jobs writing genius is certainly equal to her father's technique",

Have also had some interesting discussions (in person and via text) with younger family members that have caused me to change some habits (no more hard stops [periods] in text messages lol)",

Carr pulls together several strands of research and findings, and brings in the findings from scholarly journals to present several important consequences of the widespread use of the internet. The ideas are not all his, but he puts them together in a very well-written and readily digestible short read. We should all take note of his conclusions. The internet is changing the way we think - and we need to comprehend exactly how.",

I have been fascinated with what researchers are saying about the effects of the Web on our brains and and thought processes. Disappointingly, this book offers no groundbreaking insights in this topic, and for that matter any other. Carr opens the first chapters of this book with a long tedious history of the printed word and how that has affected thought and information processing. While this might be vital to his argument about how the Internet is changing the brain, it seems to go on forever. Could this information not been condensed into a chapter or so? Once Carr gets to the research on how the Web is changing our brains, he seems to go into long-drawn out descriptions of chemical processes and descriptions of physiological descriptions of how the Web is basically making us shallow thinkers, unable to think deeply about what we read and see on the Net. I was just a bit disappointed by Carr''s treatment of a subject that has a great deal of merit, and a subject that needs to be discussed. In the end, this was one of those books that was difficult to finish. Plowing is the accurate term to describe how I moved through this book. While Carr does an adequate job of describing what the research says about how the Web is changing us, he does so in an uninspiring and didactic manner. This could have been an interesting book, but it reads too much like a diatribe against technology in general.",

Hawking presents information on the history of the universe, motion of the universe and most exhilarating of all, black holes. He includes his perception and opinions of the universe and its past as well as the physics acting upon it as time passes He presents the writing in reasonable short chapters that help you understand him and all of his reasoning as well as the tons of background information that he has researched and drawn his observations from. I would recommend this as a read for anyone that has even a slight interest in astronomy and the cosmos. Stephen Hawking teaches you about simple and general astronomy and from that draws major theories that are constantly changing as we learn more about our universe through technological innovations. There are many pages that will have to be read multiple times before you can really understand what he is even talking about. This isn''t really a book that you can skim through or you are bound to miss something vital to the theory of relativity or some function of quantum physics. Since it is so thorough, unlike some books, you WILL put it down. Chances are, you''ll throw it down in frustration with Hawking, but you will be rewarded in the end when you realize how blatantly he put some of the most complex thoughts and information accessible to humans. I enjoyed Hawkings sense of humor and voice in his writing. Before I read this book, physics seemed extremely dry and boring but he adds humor and feeling and made me captivated by concepts. I felt like I was sitting in a classroom while I read this, hearing the teachers voice rambling on and on and on about something I didn''t really care about until he cracked a joke that I just caught through the blur of boredom. I let out a little chuckle and grin then realize that the subject is exhilarating and fun. I had no dislike from this book, just shock and a",

Although Mr. Collins did not walk on the Moon, as he was the Astronaut who piloted the Command Module, he does an incredible job explaining the process leading up to this achievement of mankind and clearly articulates for the learned as well as the novice, the actions he, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin carried out on Apollo 11 to successfully make and complete the journey. The reader also gains new respect for the many, many people who were part of the process to bring this wonderful accomplishment to fruition; understanding too, there were those who lost their lives along the journey to success...I can''t help but think of the Apollo 1 Crew, Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee!

Now that I have done so I find that I don''t really know quite how to express what it is about Michael Collins'' writing that moved me so much - except that I know this is most definitely one of the best memoirs I''ve ever read. It is truly a one-off, as the events it describes are so unique (most obviously the historic Apollo 11 mission) that they could only have been written by one of the members of 1960s NASA space program who was actually ''there''.Collins'' writing is very laid back and as informal as it is informative. I rarely read books (for pleasure at least) with quite so much scientific content - rocket propulsion, trajectories, inter-planetary navigation, and so forth, but he puts these topics into words that I found no problem in understanding. Not that these subjects really dominate the narrative - his tale is told in a very personal and humourous style. For an astronaut (& fighter pilot for that matter!) Collins is incredibly humble and self-effacing - he repeatedly reminds the reader of how poor a mechanic he is and how lazy he can be...The early chapters retell his experiences as a USAF test pilot while in the background NASA''s manned space program is underway. After some early setbacks he is eventually accepted into the astronaut staff at NASA in Houston, and begins the arduous training for the Gemini program. Amidst tales of geological field trips and survival training in inhospitable desert or jungle environments (in the event of any future re-entry going awry), and endless sickness inducing zero gravity dives, he gives a great sense to the day to day existence of an astronaut-in-waiting. As enjoyable as these pages are, the reader knows - as does the author of course - that it is all building up to the momentous day when he will finally sit at the ''tip of the pencil on the",

The Pluto Files is a glimpse behind the scenes of museums and other scientific institutions and how they deal with the public and the changing status of their chosen field. There''s just enough straight science described so the reader can familiarize themselves with the topic. Nothing that can be handled by a high school student. Dr. Tyson found himself, unintentionally, in the middle of the controversy over the continuing planethood of far away Pluto.

You know this guy's got a point!\u00bf With an impressive understanding of the human social condition and our psychological tendencies, Taleb lays good claim to how we fail to anticipate, react to and make sense of the random events that have the greatest impact on our lives. In the end Taleb offers no specific solution or process by which one can profit or gain from the unexpected... however, the reader invariably learns the value of 'skepticism' and can easily see how this primarily philosophical dogma can be applicable to real life and of course, the financial markets!

Like everyone else, says Taleb, these so-called 'experts' fail to appreciate 'black swans': highly consequential but unlikely events that render predictions and standard explanations worse than worthless. Taleb's style is personal and literary, but his heterodox insights are rigorous (if sometimes jolted by authorial filigree). This combination makes for a thrilling, disturbing, contentious and unforgettable book on chance and randomness.

I was surprised at how easily I understood this book. The author presents calculus with an easy mindset instead of a difficult one which greatly helps the reader to come at it at an easy approach. I would highly recommend this to ANYONE.",

Offering excellent bird's-eye views of key calculus concepts, Mr. Ryan then develops them in a clear, easy-to-understand manner that will give you one \"Eureka!\" moment after another.  I recommend this book as an overview for the curious, a review for the rusty, or as introductory material prior to tackling Calculus I.  It includes an excellent summary of the highlights of pre-calculus material for review.  For more hands-on exercises, \"Calculus Workbook for Dummies\" is an excellent companion volume.",

Hofstadter's book, which is literally in a class by itself, reaches out in thought to music, art, biology, writing, religion... and all the rest of it, all through the lens of the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem, which is about the inability of proving something about a system from within the system. And that, to my mind, is pretty much everything there is to say about 'mind'. What else can I say? I was a 24-year-old with a B.A. in English and no math since High School algebra II when I read this book now I'm a PhD in mathematics, and I use this book in a first year seminar.",

        "comment": "A concise introduction to systems thinking. It starts with diagrams (supported by a technical appendix) to illustrate key relationships, like feedback dynamics. Then the author tries to extract some basic insights from systems analysis that might be useful to businesses, policy-makers, and even personal lives. These are expressed in simple English with catchy sounding rules of thumb. Finally, the book turns to a spiritual guide (\"Dance with the system.\") The book was intended for a wide audience and has attractive features to that end. However, it is rather heavy on the mysticism and spirituality and rather thin on the connection between cases of systems analysis and the rules of thumb for decision-making issues. Also, it is always surprising to see how systems analysts ignore their own devices when studying the economy. They assume away incentives and prices and model behavior as mechanical rules, such as always invest x percent of profits. Naturally, when mechanical rules of behavior are combined with presumed delays in perception or adjustment, there will arise nonlinear responses to shocks. Systems analysts ought to be the first to recognize that behavioral responses will adjust rather than mechanically march on. This failure stems from the engineering and computer science backgrounds of systems analysts, such as Dr. Meadows herself, where human behavior is coded as constants of proportionality, rather than (semi) rational behavior. All in all, however, I did enjoy this short book, and, at the very least, it conveys some fundamental and important insights resulting from decades of systems analysis.",
