When she was young, Lisa\u2019s father was a mythical figure who was rarely present in her life. As she grew older, her father took an interest in her, ushering her into a new world of mansions, vacations, and private schools. His attention was thrilling, but he could also be cold, critical and unpredictable. When her relationship with her mother grew strained in high school, Lisa decided to move in with her father, hoping he\u2019d become the parent she\u2019d always wanted him to be. Part portrait of a complex family, part love letter to California in the seventies and eighties, Small Fry is a poignant coming-of-age story from one of our most exciting new literary voices.",

Pluto is entrenched in our cultural and emotional view of the cosmos, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, award-winning author and director of the Rose Center, is on a quest to discover why. He stood at the heart of the controversy over Pluto''s demotion, and consequently Plutophiles have freely shared their opinions with him, including endless hate mail from third-graders. With his inimitable wit, Tyson delivers a minihistory of planets, describes the oversized characters of the people who study them, and recounts how America''s favorite planet was ousted from the cosmic hub.",

By the time he was thirteen, Urschel was auditing a college-level calculus course. But when he joined his high school football team, a new interest began to eclipse the thrill he felt in the classroom. Football challenged Urschel in an entirely different way, and he became addicted to the physical contact of the sport. After he accepted a scholarship to play at Penn State, his love of math was rekindled. As a Nittany Lion, he refused to sacrifice one passion for the other. Against the odds, Urschel found a way to manage his double life as a scholar and an athlete. While he was an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, he simultaneously pursued his PhD in mathematics at MIT.",

        "comment": "It was a struggle to read this book. The writing is brilliant and luminous, but the story is hard. Lisa Brennan-Jobs grew up as the unexpected and often unacknowledged daughter of Steve Jobs and artist Chrisann Brennan. I''ll admit, I''m not terribly interested in the personal lives of the rich and famous so I didn''t know much about Steve Jobs going into this book. To say he was a difficult man is an understatement, to say he was cruel, emotionally distant and often emotionally abusive towards his daughter is closer to the truth. In this book Lisa shares in exquisite and uncompromising detail, what it is like to grow up feeling abandoned and unwanted. Even her mother, who was a constant presence, was unable to provide the stability and emotional security a young child requires. Often as I was reading I wondered if Lisa was better off before her father acknowledged her rather than after she went to live with him. His ability to withdraw approval and affection were callous and calculated. He seems unable to connect emotionally with everyone around him, and his conversations and actions are often disconnected, if not wildly inappropriate. Lisa''s writing is poetic and filled with nostalgic images and experiences of what it was like to grow up in the 1980''s. Her memories are sharp and vibrant, evoking a visceral response from the reader. Even while she speaks of the ambivalence of her relationship with her father and the turbulence of her relationship with her mother, she remains firmly rooted in place and time in which she grew up. Her sense of place and time shine throughout the memoir and are as much a part of the story as the people who inhabit it. While this book isn''t an easy read by any means, it is a worthy one. Brennan-Jobs writing genius is certainly equal to her father's technique",

The ideas are not all his, but he puts them together in a very well-written and readily digestible short read. We should all take note of his conclusions.

I have been fascinated with what researchers are saying about the effects of the Web on our brains and and thought processes. Disappointingly, this book offers no groundbreaking insights in this topic, and for that matter any other. Carr opens the first chapters of this book with a long tedious history of the printed word and how that has affected thought and information processing. While this might be vital to his argument about how the Internet is changing the brain, it seems to go on forever. Could this information not been condensed into a chapter or so? Once Carr gets to the research on how the Web is changing our brains, he seems to go into long-drawn out descriptions of chemical processes and descriptions of physiological descriptions of how the Web is basically making us shallow thinkers, unable to think deeply about what we read and see on the Net. I was just a bit disappointed by Carr''s treatment of a subject that has a great deal of merit, and a subject that needs to be discussed. In the end, this was one of those books that was difficult to finish. Plowing is the accurate term to describe how I moved through this book. While Carr does an adequate job of describing what the research says about how the Web is changing us, he does so in an uninspiring and didactic manner. This could have been an interesting book, but it reads too much like a diatribe against technology in general.",

Hawking presents information on the history of the universe, motion of the universe and most exhilarating of all, black holes. He includes his perception and opinions of the universe and its past as well as the physics acting upon it as time passes He presents the writing in reasonable short chapters that help you understand him and all of his reasoning as well as the tons of background information that he has researched and drawn his observations from. I would recommend this as a read for anyone that has even a slight interest in astronomy and the cosmos. Stephen Hawking teaches you about simple and general astronomy and from that draws major theories that are constantly changing as we learn more about our universe through technological innovations. There are many pages that will have to be read multiple times before you can really understand what he is even talking about. This isn''t really a book that you can skim through or you are bound to miss something vital to the theory of relativity or some function of quantum physics. Since it is so thorough, unlike some books, you WILL put it down. Chances are, you''ll throw it down in frustration with Hawking, but you will be rewarded in the end when you realize how blatantly he put some of the most complex thoughts and information accessible to humans. I enjoyed Hawkings sense of humor and voice in his writing. Before I read this book, physics seemed extremely dry and boring but he adds humor and feeling and made me captivated by concepts. I felt like I was sitting in a classroom while I read this, hearing the teachers voice rambling on and on and on about something I didn''t really care about until he cracked a joke that I just caught through the blur of boredom. I let out a little chuckle and grin then realize that the subject is exhilarating and fun. I had no dislike from this book, just shock and a",

The reader also gains new respect for the many, many people who were part of the process to bring this wonderful accomplishment to fruition; understanding too, there were those who lost their lives along the journey to success...I can''t help but think of the Apollo 1 Crew, Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee!

Now that I have done so I find that I don''t really know quite how to express what it is about Michael Collins'' writing that moved me so much - except that I know this is most definitely one of the best memoirs I''ve ever read. It is truly a one-off, as the events it describes are so unique (most obviously the historic Apollo 11 mission) that they could only have been written by one of the members of 1960s NASA space program who was actually ''there''.Collins'' writing is very laid back and as informal as it is informative. I rarely read books (for pleasure at least) with quite so much scientific content - rocket propulsion, trajectories, inter-planetary navigation, and so forth, but he puts these topics into words that I found no problem in understanding. Not that these subjects really dominate the narrative - his tale is told in a very personal and humourous style. For an astronaut (& fighter pilot for that matter!) Collins is incredibly humble and self-effacing - he repeatedly reminds the reader of how poor a mechanic he is and how lazy he can be...The early chapters retell his experiences as a USAF test pilot while in the background NASA''s manned space program is underway. After some early setbacks he is eventually accepted into the astronaut staff at NASA in Houston, and begins the arduous training for the Gemini program. Amidst tales of geological field trips and survival training in inhospitable desert or jungle environments (in the event of any future re-entry going awry), and endless sickness inducing zero gravity dives, he gives a great sense to the day to day existence of an astronaut-in-waiting. As enjoyable as these pages are, the reader knows - as does the author of course - that it is all building up to the momentous day when he will finally sit at the ''tip of the pencil on the",

In The Black Swan, Taleb shows that all human knowledge is but a collection of crude marks on a vast canvas of ignorance. We know much less than we think we know, and understand even that poorly. Further, our history, both personal and collective, is governed by events that we did not predict, could not have predicted, and really do not comprehend.",

Through his anecdotal reasoning Taleb illustrates case after case and historical reference after historical reference with a unique narrative style that is slightly fragmented yet nearly as entertaining as what you might expect from a work of fiction often leaving the reader with a discernable smile while mumbling to himself: 'Hmmm... You know this guy's got a point!\u00bf With an impressive understanding of the human social condition and our psychological tendencies, Taleb lays good claim to how we fail to anticipate, react to and make sense of the random events that have the greatest impact on our lives. In the end Taleb offers no specific solution or process by which one can profit or gain from the unexpected... however, the reader invariably learns the value of 'skepticism' and can easily see how this primarily philosophical dogma can be applicable to real life and of course, the financial markets! The Black Swan does more to re-align one's perspective than anything else, but few books do as good a job in this regard.",

The same could be said for philosopher, essayist and trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who finds something rotten in misguided yet supremely confident investment gurus, traders, hedge fund managers, Wall Street bankers, M.B.A.s, CEOs, Nobel-winning economists and others who claim that they can predict the future and explain the past. Like everyone else, says Taleb, these so-called 'experts' fail to appreciate 'black swans': highly consequential but unlikely events that render predictions and standard explanations worse than worthless. Taleb's style is personal and literary, but his heterodox insights are rigorous (if sometimes jolted by authorial filigree). This combination makes for a thrilling, disturbing, contentious and unforgettable book on chance and randomness. While Taleb offers strong medicine some readers may find too bitter at times, we prescribe it to anyone who wants a powerful inoculation against gullibility.",

We can profit by betting on long shots, doing it a lot, but placing only small bets. That way, the losses will be bounded and you never suffer from catastrophic black swan events.

Then the author tries to extract some basic insights from systems analysis that might be useful to businesses, policy-makers, and even personal lives. These are expressed in simple English with catchy sounding rules of thumb. Finally, the book turns to a spiritual guide (\"Dance with the system.\") The book was intended for a wide audience and has attractive features to that end. However, it is rather heavy on the mysticism and spirituality and rather thin on the connection between cases of systems analysis and the rules of thumb for decision-making issues. Also, it is always surprising to see how systems analysts ignore their own devices when studying the economy. They assume away incentives and prices and model behavior as mechanical rules, such as always invest x percent of profits. Naturally, when mechanical rules of behavior are combined with presumed delays in perception or adjustment, there will arise nonlinear responses to shocks. Systems analysts ought to be the first to recognize that behavioral responses will adjust rather than mechanically march on. This failure stems from the engineering and computer science backgrounds of systems analysts, such as Dr. Meadows herself, where human behavior is coded as constants of proportionality, rather than (semi) rational behavior. All in all, however, I did enjoy this short book, and, at the very least, it conveys some fundamental and important insights resulting from decades of systems analysis.",

One kilo of refined Micromium can power a major metropolitan city for an entire year without any environmentally harmful side effects. There's much promise - but the team's latest probe may turn out to be their last as truths emerge that threaten not just projects and ideals, but lives.  Micromium may sound like classic sci-fi, but its roots lie just as heavily in a mystery as in its backdrop of Mars. Readers who turn to it expecting the mundane trappings of science fiction will uncover much more as they become involved in a blend of murder mystery, ethical conundrums, and corporate corruption and revelations that heavily impact mining operations and lives.

Multi-faceted and engaging, this is a book for readers of all ages, educational and professional backgrounds. It isn't too technical or in any way alienating. At first I assumed it was a history book, but it turned out to be more prediction and guesswork -- a book of possibilities. What I appreciate about this is that Reese isn't spoon-feeding the reader his own opinions but rather giving room for us to decide what to buy, which I find extremely relevant to our \"post-truth\" society (i.e. being saturated in information / not knowing what to believe). The reading 'pathway' is our choice, yet we get to see the bigger picture from other points-of-view and belief systems. Besides the fascinating topic, the writing is inclusive, empathetic and well-informed. As a side note, Reese is one of the most hopeful writers I've read -- and it's nice to find someone who believes in humanity.",

Reese strikes the perfect balance between easy to understand and thorough. It wasn\u2019t preachy or bogged down with technical facts, like a lot of nonfiction books on AI are. Instead, his book kept me hooked and was well-written in layman terms. Even though I have no background in AI or in computers, I was able to follow and understand Reese\u2019s carefully laid-out arguments and thought process. In media, we often only see polarized views with outlandish claims on the future of AI. Thus, The Fourth Age is especially eye-opening because Reese maintains a neutral point of view and provides the reader ample evidence to support his ultimate conclusions. He entertains all possible scenarios/theories regarding unemployment, affluence, quality of life, and conscious AI. Then he gives the reader the comprehensive rundown on how likely they are to happen. But what fascinated me the most was Reese\u2019s exploration of the big philosophical questions that the future of AI raises. He challenges us to reconsider what it means to be conscious and what it means to be a human. We often think of computers as cold and mechanistic, embedded in the STEM field, but Reese shatters that notion by showing how fundamentally connected philosophy and AI are in an incredibly provocative way. Overall, The Fourth Age is an informative, gripping read that sheds light on the murky world of AI.",

Melia's HE Astrophysics fills that void with a well-thought out list of topics, including both the experimental and theoretical elements of this important branch of astronomy and astrophysics. There is probably too much information here to cover in a single-semester class, but the student will find it easy to read beyond the material assigned to any given course that adopts this book, since Melia's writing style is elegant and compact. I found it also interesting that the problems and solutions are being distributed in a separate volume. No doubt this separation was chosen to make it easier for someone other than a student interested in this field to read it as a monograph rather than a textbook. All in all, this book belongs on the shelves of any serious astronomer or astrophysicist, alongside Weinberg's classic book on Gravitation, and Rybicki's book on Radiative Processes. Over time, it will become one of the most important selections in Princeton's famed astrophysics series which, by the way, includes another classic book, Binney's Galactic Dynamics.",

        "comment": "Stephen Hawking's book, THE UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL, succeeds in making some of the newest theories in physics understandable to everyday people. Until reading this book, I hadn't considered what conditions would be necessary in order for our night-time sky to look completely white with stars, nor had I seen such a gorgeous depiction of the micro and macro-cosmic universe in a nutshell (cover illustration). Hawking carefully examines time-travel, predicting the future, and the shape of time after starting the book with an overview of the theory of relativity. Hawking saves his biggest question for last, to leave readers wondering 'Do we live on a brane, or are we just holograms?' (A brane is something like a membrane.) Thanks to stunning color illustrations and fascinating questions and ideas gracing almost every page, THE UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL accesses both the rational and intuitive hemispheres of the reader's brain. It's the perfect book to unwind with after a long day -- allowing the exotic images and ideas to percolate in your mind like a delicious cup of your favorite hot beverage -- opening your mind to whole new worlds of possibility. Those seeking mathematical equations to accompany their theoretical physics will likely be disappointed by this coffee-table masterpiece, as will readers who prefer to read ground-breaking books which describe entirely new theories in physics. Pretty much everyone else will be thrilled to take a peek at the 'big' questions and ideas being contemplated by the world's most famous physicist.",

        "comment": "This book is a very successful popular science book. Prof Stephen Hawking uses very simple language to explain complicated physics. However, the M-Theory or superstring theory may not be the ultimate grand unified theory. Go to read a book entitled &quot;Theories of Everything by logic&quot; by Wan-Jiung Hu. He proposes a grand unified theory by explaining the origin of dark matter and dark energy.",

        "comment": "The reason that this book is getting 3 stars mainly is because there are no pictures or diagrams. It is very frustrating reading Tesla's works and he is mentioning to look at a figure or to look at a part of the diagram to explain something when you do not have the image to look at. The cover of the book does not mention that it does not come with pictures/diagrams, nor does it mention it in the summary that you would read before buying it. The only place that it is mentioned is in the last two sentences in A Note on the text (Found after the introduction). This section tells the reader that if they want to have access of the images, the New York City Library has them. That is great if you live in New York and are a member of the library. They do not give an alternative way to get the images, such as a website. I feel cheated because of this and feel I did not get my money's worth. Overall, the collection of Nikola Tesla's original writings gave me a better understanding on how he thinks. It was not what I expected and feel I will be reading the writings multiple times to make sure I get everything. I enjoyed the book. I recommend reading the introduction by Samantha Hunt before reading the writings and again after reading the writings. Her introduction gives the reader a nice preview about Tesla, so the reader has an idea what to expect when you read his works. Reading the introduction after reading Tesla writings will just help confirm what the introduction was telling you before. I do recommend that the reader may want to read up about Tesla before reading his works, so you have an idea of what he is talking about when he discusses his inventions or ideas.",

It was very helpful and I like that it included topics on grades 7 and 8, so we can practice and improve on her math over the summer to prepare her for the new work she will have to learn. The illustrations overall set up of the book is so easy and fun to follow. My daughter likes it as well.

Most of us slip through and hope for the best from high school. Bad strategy, this is the book to put you on the road to alegebraic fluency. There was a Prof out there who thought this book was a bad book, probably because it gave the game away. Ordinary folks can become mathematically proficient and actually use the stuff.",

Author Tim Chartier, has written an outstanding book that discusses mathematical techniques that can recognize a disguised celebrity and rank web pages with the roll of a pair of dice.  The author begins by applying mathematics to a variety of topics. Next, he shows you how even the most foundational mathematical operation can be tricky and requires attention. Then, the author discusses various mathematical techniques, which are similar to a search algorithm in computer science, known as a binary search, which can find an entry called the search key in a sorted list. In addition, he examines how to create an image point by point (which can be very difficult and, indeed quite time consuming), which is called a fractal and known as Sierpinski&rsquo;s triangle. Also, the author shows you how functions like y = 3x + 1 and y = 5 - x&sup2; enable a computer to create a font like the one that comprises these words or plot the path of an Angry Bird through the air. He then begins doodling as inspired by E.B. Burger and, by the end, use a math theorem to create a maze. Next, the author continues by showing you how to mathematically transform a digital image into a stylized portrait. Then, he shows you how the sugary surface of your cake can be a workplace to perform some calculus or calculate an estimate to the value of pi. In addition, he explains how computers allow for easy methods of image manipulation. Also, the author then works with a library of grayscale images of 16 famous people (with regards to facial recognition), in order to find the combination of these pictures that best approximates a target image. He then explains the mathematical complexities of predicting the 64-team bracket during March Madness; of which there are 9 quintillion ways to fill out a 64-team bracket. Next, the author shows you how to answer the question: What are some of the",
